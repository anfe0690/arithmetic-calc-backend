- The DBMS is H2. The database files are saved in the Working Directory (current directory) with the name
`arithmetic-calculator.*` where `*` is for multiple extensions like `mv.db` and `trace.db` and others. Use the following
as an example of a JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:/Users/user/projects/arithmetic-calculator-backend/arithmetic-calculator`
